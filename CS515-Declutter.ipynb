The creation   * process of a DBF is iterative. At the start, the DBF is a <code>1 * m</code>  * bit matrix, i.e., it is composed of a single standard Bloom filter.  * It assumes that <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> elements are recorded in the   * initial bit vector, where <code>n<sub>r</sub> <= n</code> (<code>n</code> is  * the cardinality of the set <code>A</code> to record in the filter).    * <p>  * As the size of <code>A</code> grows during the execution of the application,  * several keys must be inserted in the DBF.  When inserting a key into the DBF,  * one must first get an active Bloom filter in the matrix.  A Bloom filter is  * active when the number of recorded keys, <code>n<sub>r</sub></code>, is   * strictly less than the current cardinality of <code>A</code>, <code>n</code>.  * If an active Bloom filter is found, the key is inserted and   * <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is incremented by one. On the other hand, if there  * is no active Bloom filter, a new one is created (i.e., a new row is added to  * the matrix) according to the current size of <code>A</code> and the element  * is added in this new Bloom filter and the <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> value of  * this new Bloom filter is set to one.  A given key is said to belong to the  * DBF if the <code>k</code> positions are set to one in one of the matrix rows.  * <p>  * Originally created by  * <a href=\"http://www.one-lab.org\">European Commission One-Lab Project 034819</a>.\n",
