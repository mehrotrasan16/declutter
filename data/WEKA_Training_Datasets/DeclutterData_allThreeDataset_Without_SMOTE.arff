The idea is now to intercept the process and add an additional step: - The user selects a date in the popup which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The date is converted to a {@link TemporalAccessor} (i.e enriched by a time component) using {@link #addCurrentTime(LocalDate)} - The string converter ({@link #stringConverterProperty()}) is used to transform the temporal accessor to a string representation and display it in the text field.

When inserting a key into the DBF  * one must first get an active Bloom filter in the matrix.  A Bloom filter is  * active when the number of recorded keys <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is   * strictly less than the current cardinality of <code>A</code> <code>n</code>.  * If an active Bloom filter is found the key is inserted and   * <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is incremented by one. On the other hand if there  * is no active Bloom filter a new one is created (i.e. a new row is added to  * the matrix) according to the current size of <code>A</code> and the element  * is added in this new Bloom filter and the <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> value of  * this new Bloom filter is set to one.  A given key is said to belong to the  * DBF if the <code>k</code> positions are set to one in one of the matrix rows.  * <p>  * Originally created by  * <a href=http://www.one-lab.org>European Commission One-Lab Project 034819</a>.','/* The remote binary location and skip download option */',' A simple benchmark to find out the difference in speed between block  * and page blobs.','Writes data to the given stream of the given size flushing every    * x bytes.',' Writes data to the given file of the given size flushing every    * x bytes.

The creation   * process of a DBF is iterative. At the start the DBF is a <code>1 * m</code>  * bit matrix i.e. it is composed of a single standard Bloom filter.  * It assumes that <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> elements are recorded in the   * initial bit vector where <code>n<sub>r</sub> <= n</code> (<code>n</code> is  * the cardinality of the set <code>A</code> to record in the filter).    * <p>  * As the size of <code>A</code> grows during the execution of the application  * several keys must be inserted in the DBF.  When inserting a key into the DBF  * one must first get an active Bloom filter in the matrix.  A Bloom filter is  * active when the number of recorded keys <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is   * strictly less than the current cardinality of <code>A</code> <code>n</code>.  * If an active Bloom filter is found the key is inserted and   * <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is incremented by one. On the other hand if there  * is no active Bloom filter a new one is created (i.e. a new row is added to  * the matrix) according to the current size of <code>A</code> and the element  * is added in this new Bloom filter and the <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> value of  * this new Bloom filter is set to one.  A given key is said to belong to the  * DBF if the <code>k</code> positions are set to one in one of the matrix rows.  * <p>  * Originally created by  * <a href=http://www.one-lab.org>European Commission One-Lab Project 034819</a>.',no
