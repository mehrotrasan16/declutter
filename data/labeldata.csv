"A date picker with configurable datetime format where both date and time can be changed via the text field and the date can additionally be changed via the JavaFX default date picker.

The idea is now to intercept the process and add an additional step: - The user selects a date in the popup, which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The date is converted to a {@link TemporalAccessor} (i.e, enriched by a time component) using {@link #addCurrentTime(LocalDate)} - The string converter ({@link #stringConverterProperty()}) is used to transform the temporal accessor to a string representation and display it in the text field.

Currently, JabRef won't start with Java 9 either, but the warning that it cannot be used with this version is helpful anyway to prevent users to update from an old 1.8 directly to version 9.

The creation   * process of a DBF is iterative. At the start, the DBF is a <code>1 * m</code>  * bit matrix, i.e., it is composed of a single standard Bloom filter.  * It assumes that <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> elements are recorded in the   * initial bit vector, where <code>n<sub>r</sub> <= n</code> (<code>n</code> is  * the cardinality of the set <code>A</code> to record in the filter).    * <p>  * As the size of <code>A</code> grows during the execution of the application,  * several keys must be inserted in the DBF.  When inserting a key into the DBF,  * one must first get an active Bloom filter in the matrix.  A Bloom filter is  * active when the number of recorded keys, <code>n<sub>r</sub></code>, is   * strictly less than the current cardinality of <code>A</code>, <code>n</code>.  * If an active Bloom filter is found, the key is inserted and   * <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is incremented by one. On the other hand, if there  * is no active Bloom filter, a new one is created (i.e., a new row is added to  * the matrix) according to the current size of <code>A</code> and the element  * is added in this new Bloom filter and the <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> value of  * this new Bloom filter is set to one.  A given key is said to belong to the  * DBF if the <code>k</code> positions are set to one in one of the matrix rows.  * <p>  * Originally created by  * <a href=""http://www.one-lab.org"">European Commission One-Lab Project 034819</a>.",no
